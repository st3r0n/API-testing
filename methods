+++++++++++API RECON+++++++++++++++
for api testing fisrts tep is to gather as much as information we can in order to interact and exploit the api
look for api request like GET /api/ or POST /api in initial recon
after recon we need to find how to interact with 
this may include 1 using appropirate methods like GET POST PATCH OPTIONS etc
2 content type like application/sjson or www-x-url-encoded or other type
3 rate limits and auth mechanisms

WE CAN LOOK AT API DOCUMENTATIONS IF WE FIND WHAT API IS BEING USED   ----> for this we can either use openapi parser(Bapp) if server is using openapi or we can also use postman
or we can find the documentation in following ways:
look for patterns similar to: 
    /api
    /swagger/index.html
    /openapi.json

and if you found any documenatation like above try to go backward one step at a time like (we found api request as /api/swagger/v1/users/123 )

    /api/swagger/v1
    /api/swagger
    /api
this can also gives us documenattaions
NB -----> ALSO LOOK AT JS FILES THEY MAY CONTAIN LOCATION TO SOME API ENDPOINTS    (for automation we can use js link finder)
 API endpoints often expect data in a specific format. They may therefore behave differently 
depending on the content type of the data provided in a request. Changing the content type may enable you to:
 Trigger errors that disclose useful information.
    Bypass flawed defenses.
    Take advantage of differences in processing logic. For example, an API may be secure when handling JSON data but susceptible to injection attacks when dealing with XML.
To change the content type, modify the Content-Type header, then reformat the request body accordingly
You can use the Content type converter BApp to automatically convert data submitted within requests between XML and JSON.
