+++++++++++API RECON+++++++++++++++
for api testing fisrts tep is to gather as much as information we can in order to interact and exploit the api
look for api request like GET /api/ or POST /api in initial recon
after recon we need to find how to interact with 
this may include 1 using appropirate methods like GET POST PATCH OPTIONS etc
2 content type like application/sjson or www-x-url-encoded or other type
3 rate limits and auth mechanisms

WE CAN LOOK AT API DOCUMENTATIONS IF WE FIND WHAT API IS BEING USED   ----> for this we can either use openapi parser(Bapp) if server is using openapi
or we can find the documentation in following ways:
look for patterns similar to: 
    /api
    /swagger/index.html
    /openapi.json

and if you found any documenatation like above try to go backward one step at a time like (we found api request as /api/swagger/v1/users/123 )

    /api/swagger/v1
    /api/swagger
    /api
this can also gives us documenattaions
